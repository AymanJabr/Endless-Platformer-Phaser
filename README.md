# Simple Platformer

In this project, I created a very simple platformer game using Phaser3, a Javascript-based library for creating games. This is an arcade game, meaning that the goal is to get as much of a high score as possible.

## Instructions

You can play the game right now [by clicking here](https://simple-platform-jumper.netlify.app/)

Use the arrow keys to move around in the game, collect as many stars as possible while avoiding the bombs.

## Built With

- JavaScript
- Jest
- Webpack
- Phaser3

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

1. Clone or copy repository, and navigate to the the `development` branch

2. Run `npm install` to install all required node packages

3. Run `npm run start` this will start up a local server, and open a new tab at `http://localhost:8080/`

4. If you wish to build a deployment version of the game, run `npm run build`, this will create all the necessary compressed files in the `dist` directory

## Testing

Run `npm jest` to run the tests.
